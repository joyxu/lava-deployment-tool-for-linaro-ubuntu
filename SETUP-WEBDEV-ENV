Setup LAVA Web Application Development Environment
==================================================

Setup Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^

Prepare a requirements file that doesn't include the LAVA webapp which you want
to develop in. e.g. if you want to develop lava-scheduler, make a
requirements-dev.txt as follow:

lava-server
lava-dashboard

Then follow the steps:

$ ./lava-deployment-tool setup
$ ./lava-deployment-tool bundle requirements-dev.txt
$ ./lava-development-tool install dev lava.pybundle
$ ./lava-development-tool manage dev createsuperuser

Toggle developer mode during the installation.

Checkout lava-scheduler source code in /srv/lava/instances/dev/src:

$ cd /srv/lava/instances/dev/src
$ bzr branch lp:lava-scheduler

After adding a component, run the following command to ensure the component is
integrated with the rest of the application:

$ ./lava-deployment-tool install_config_app dev

Activate virtualenv:

$ . /srv/lava/instances/dev/bin/activate

Setup develop environment in webapp:

$ cd /srv/lava/instances/dev/src/lava-scheduler
$ ./setup.py develop

Setup and sync the database:
$ ./lava-deployment-tool manage dev syncdb
$ ./lava-deployment-tool manage dev migrate

Touch the uwsgi.reload to restart the uwsgi, you can find the log by
'tail -F dev/var/log/lava-uwsgi.log' in another console:

$ touch etc/lava-server/uwsgi.reload

If uwsgi fails to reload, try to start it again:

$ sudo start lava-instance-uwsgi LAVA_INSTANCE=env

On Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick), comment the following line in 
/etc/init/lava-server-uwsgi.conf:

# kill signal xxx

Now you can browse the lava-server from http://<Your IP>/

When you do some changes to lava-scheduler webapp code, reload related webapp
to load the changes:

$ touch etc/lava-server/uwsgi.reload

If it doesn't take effect, try:

$ sudo restart lava-instance-scheduler LAVA_INSTANCE=dev

Notes
^^^^^

* Don't run 'setup.py develop' without activating the virtualenv from the
  instance.

* Editing templates does not require restarting uwsgi.

* You may want to enable debug mode in
  /srv/lava/instances/dev/etc/lava-server/lava-server.conf

* If you change code, touch the uwsgi file

* If you want to change scheduler code (not the web parts) you'll have to
  restart lava-instance-scheduler:

$ sudo restart lava-instance-scheduler LAVA_INSTANCE=dev

* If you have more than one instance installed on the machine, there are two
  ways to make it browsable from http://<IP>/

  a) disable other sites

$ cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
$ ls
lab.conf dev.conf
$ sudo a2dissite lab.conf
$ sudo restart apache2

  b) allow multiple sites together
