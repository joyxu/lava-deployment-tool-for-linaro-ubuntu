Setup LAVA Web Application Development Environment
==================================================

Setup Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Don't include the lava webapp which you want to develop in
requirements-dev.txt.
E.g. if you wanna to develop lava-scheduler, make a requirements-dev.txt as
follow:

lava-server
lava-dashboard

2. $ ./lava-deployment-tool bundle requirements-dev.txt
3. $ ./lava-development-tool install dev lava.pybundle
4. Toggle developer mode during the installation.
5. Checkout lava-scheduler source code in /srv/lava/instances/dev/src:
$ cd /srv/lava/instances/dev/src
$ bzr branch lp:lava-scheduler
6. After adding a component, run the following command to ensure the component
is integrated with the rest of the app.
$ lava-deployment-tool install_config_app dev
7. Activate virtualenv:
$ . /srv/lava/instances/dev/bin/activate
8. 
$ cd /srv/lava/instances/dev/src/lava-scheduler
9. Setup develop environment in webapp
$ ./setup.py develop
10. 
$ cd /srv/lava/instances/dev/
11. touch the uwsgi.reload to restart the uwsgi, you can find the log by
'tail -F dev/var/log/lava-uwsgi.log' in another console.
$ touch etc/lava-server/uwsgi.reload
12. If uwsgi fails to reload, try to start it again:
$ sudo start lava-instance-uwsgi LAVA_INSTANCE=env
On Maverick previous Ubuntu OS, for there is an old upstart, comment the
following line in /etc/init/lava-server-uwsgi.conf first:
# kill signal xxx
13. Now you can browse the lava-server from http://<Your IP>/
14. When you do some change to lava-scheduler webapp code, reload related webapp
to load the changes:
$ sudo restart lava-instance-scheduler LAVA_INSTANCE=dev

Some Notices
^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Don't run 'setup.py develop' without activating the virtualenv from the
instance.
2. If you have more than one instance installed on the machine, there are two
ways to make it browsable from http://<IP>/
 * First is to disable other sites:

$ cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
$ ls
lab.conf dev.conf
$ sudo a2dissite lab.conf
$ sudo restart apache2

 * Second is to allow multiple sites together:
TODO

3. Editing templates does not require restarting uwsgi.
4. You may want to enable debug mode in
/srv/lava/instances/dev/etc/lava-server/lava-server.conf
5. If you change code, touch the uwsgi file
6. If you want to change scheduler code (not the web parts) you'll have to
restart lava-instance-scheduler:
$ sudo restart lava-instance-scheduler LAVA_INSTANCE=dev
