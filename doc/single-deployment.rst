Deploying Single LAVA Instances
*******************************

This section will lead you through installing a single LAVA server and
dispatcher instance on a single computer. If you wish to deploy a
distributed instance with a LAVA server and multiple worker nodes, you
should read :ref:`distributed_deployment`.


Assumptions
===========

The deployment is on the Ubuntu LTS release - currently 12.04.
   Although deployment on other Ubuntu releases may well work, Linaro
   can not guarantee or support LAVA running on anything but the
   recommended release.

The device(s) you wish to deploy in LAVA are either:
   * Physically connected to the server via usb, usb-serial, or serial
     [#f1]_
   * Connected over the network via a serial console server [#f1]_
   * A fastboot capable device accessible from the server
   * Emulated virtual machines and/or simulators that allow a serial connection

A small LAVA instance can be deployed on reasonably modest hardware.[#f2]_ We
recommend:
   * At least one 1GB of RAM for runtime activity (this is shared, on a single host, among the database server, the application server and the web server)
   * At least 20GB for application data


.. [#f1] See the section :ref:`serial_connections` for details of
         configuring serial connections to devices

.. [#f2] If you are deploying many devices and expect to be running large
         numbers of jobs, you will obviously need more RAM and disk space
