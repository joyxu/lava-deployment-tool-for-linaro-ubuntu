LAVA Deployment Tool
====================

LAVA Deployment Tool is meant to assist you setting up LAVA on your machine.
The tool is suitable for both personal and more "production" installations that
are expected to perform adequately with more concurrent users. This tool is
not, however, designed for multi-machine installation, including cloud
deployment. For that it is likely we will turn to Juju (https://juju.ubuntu.com/)

Quickstart
^^^^^^^^^^

For the impatient, or those just looking for a cheat sheet but know what they
are doing otherwise, here are the basic set of commands to get an instance::

 $ ./lava-deployment-tool setup
 $ ./lava-deployment-tool install testinstance
 $ ./lava-deployment-tool manage testinstance createsuperuser
 $ ./lava-deployment-tool manage testinstance runserver

Assuming everything went well, you should be able to point a web
browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/, see the lava-server default page
and sign-in.

Software Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We currently recommmend using Ubuntu 12.04.  This tool should work on
Ubuntu versions 11.10 (Oneiric) and newer.

If you'd like to help us with other distributions feel free to contact
us at linaro-validation (at) lists (dot) linaro (dot) org.

Hardware Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A small LAVA instance can be deployed on any modest hardware. We
recommend at least one 1GB of RAM for runtime activity (this is
shared, on a single host, among the database server, the application
server and the web server). For storage please reserve about 20GB for
application data, especially if you wish to mirror current public LAVA
instance used by Linaro.  LAVA uses append-only models so the storage
requirements will grow at about several GB a year.

Before installing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you can create your first LAVA instance (standalone, independent LAVA
installation) you must install some shared infrastructure on your machine.
Currently this is the Apache 2 web server, PostgreSQL database server, RabbitMQ
messaging server, and Python (and a few python programs and libraries). Because
this installation method is not using pre-built packages you will also need
development headers and a working compiler to build some of the native (C)
extensions for python.

This step is largely automated. To perform it run this command::

 $ ./lava-deployment-tool setup

This step also prepares file-system places for LAVA. In particular it
creates /srv/lava/ where all LAVA instances are later stored.

Creating an instance of LAVA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An instance of LAVA is a self-contained installation of LAVA.  This
means the code that makes up LAVA, configuration data, a Postgres
database, and the log files and test result bundles produced by
running tests.

You can create multiple LAVA instances on a single machine, which is
very valuable for testing and developing LAVA itself.

The code part of an instance is described by a `buildout`_
configuration file, which lives in a branch of the `lava-server`_
project on Launchpad.  By default, lava-deployment-tool creates an
instance that uses the buildout.cfg file from the most recent
revision of the lp:lava-server branch.

To create an instance, run::

 $ ./lava-deployment-tool install NAME

This will ask you a few questions and then create a fresh instance
called NAME.

You can override details about how to construct the instance:

 1. To override the branch to deploy from, set LAVA_SERVER_BRANCH in
    the environment.

 2. To override the name of the buildout config file, set
    LAVA_BUILDOUT_CFG.

 3. To deploy a specific revision of LAVA_SERVER_BRANCH, add the
    revision number to the command line:

    $ ./lava-deployment-tool install NAME <revno>

See `different kinds of deployment`_ below for more about customizing
instances.

To create an administrator user for a newly-created instance::

 $ ./lava-deployment-tool manage NAME createsuperuser

This user can access the administration panel, edit permissions to other users
and add bundle streams, devices, etc...

.. _lava-server: https://launchpad.net/lava-server

Backing Up LAVA instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LAVA instances store persistent data in two locations:

 * On the filesystem, in the directory
   /srv/lava/$LAVA_INSTANCE/var/lib/lava-server/media
 * In a PostgreSQL database in the default cluster named $LAVA_INSTANCE

Backing up those two items is sufficient to preserve the entire system
state.  You can do this by running::

 $ lava-deployment-tool backup $LAVA_INSTANCE

which will create a backup with an ID based on the current date and
time in a directory named
"/srv/lava/backups/$LAVA_INSTANCE/$SNAPSHOT_ID/".  You can make
/srv/lava/backups a symlink to a more appropriate location if you
want.

Generally before backing up you should make sure that LAVA instance is
turned off. This depends on how your instance is started. If you were
using upstart the following shell command should turn LAVA off::

 $ sudo stop lava

If you take a backup while running, you will need to do some manual
cleanup when you restore from it.

Restoring from backup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running the command ::

 $ lava-deployment-tool restore $LAVA_INSTANCE $SNAPSHOT_ID

will restore the given snapshot of the named instance.  This will
first erase the database and media files of the named instance, so be
careful what you type!

You can restore an instance from a backup taken from a distinct
instance with a command like::

 $ lava-deployment-tool restore $TARGET_INSTANCE $SOURCE_INSTANCE/$SNAPSHOT_ID

Currently to restore from a backup taken on a different machine, you
have to put it under /srv/lava/backups, then run an appropriate
"lava-deployment-tool restore" command (we will hopefully make this
more natural soon).

You cannot restore to an instance while it is running.

Updating LAVA instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some sense, each revision of $LAVA_SERVER_BRANCH is a release and
can be updated to (from time to time a revision of lp:lava-server will
receive additional testing and be tagged as a release).  You can use
lava-deployment-tool to update to a revision of the LAVA_SERVER_BRANCH
that was used for that instance::

 $ ./lava-deployment-tool upgrade <revno>

There are some points to consider:

1) Upgrades may alter the database or persistent media files. It is
   wise to perform a full system backup before each upgrade. While we
   don't anticipate catastrophic failures it's better to be safe than
   sorry. Refer to the previous chapter for details.

2) Upgrades may introduce additional dependencies, which will be
   installed automatically. Periodically we make use of additional
   third party open source libraries. Those libraries will be
   installed for a single LAVA instance _only_. Your system libraries
   are not affected by this step.

3) Upgrades require network access. If you are behind a firewall or a
   corporate http proxy you may experience failures. Please note that the
   upgrade process does not install components without first downloading all of
   the required pieces so in case of a network failure your current installation
   should not be affected. While typically only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are
   being used at times you may see attempts to connect to native protocols used
   by git, bazaar or mercurial.

4) The upgrade works by first installing the new code independently
   from the currently running code, updates a symlink to make the new
   code current, runs any database migrations that are needed and
   restarts the services.  This means that many, but not all, kinds of
   error during upgrade will not result in disruption to the running
   service.

5) Upgrading process rebuilds the collection of static assets served
   by Apache.  During that moment you may encounter a very brief
   failure to resolve some of the static assets (typically images,
   cascading style sheets and javascript libraries)

Upgrading from a pip-based instance to a buildout based instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In June 2012, we switched from a pip-based installation method to
using buildout.  lava-deployment-tool can convert a pip-based
installation to a buildout-based one, but without care this can result
in changes to the set of packages/LAVA extensions installed.

If you have no special requirements as to the extensions that should
be installed you can just run "lava-deployment-tool upgrade
$instance", and say y when prompted.

If you have custom requirements, you should:

 1. create a test instance

 2. in this test instance, create custom buildout config file (see
    `Limited Deployments`_ below) that installs the components you
    want

 3. put this config file into the root of your existing instance as a
    filed called, say, custom.cfg

 4. run LAVA_BUILDOUT_CFG=../../custom.cfg upgrade $instance

Testing this process several times before running it on your
production instance is advisable!

Installing multiple LAVA instances on single IP machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing and starting a LAVA instance using the instructions above,
you can use "toggle" sub command to change how you access the instance.
This is particularly useful for development and testing where you may
not want to, or be able to setup vhosts for all of the instances you
install locally.

For instance, if you wanted to have two instances installed locally
called "test1" and "test2", you can use the "location" toggle to set it
so that you can access them on your local machine using:
http://localhost/test1
http://localhost/test2 ::

 $ lava-deployment-tool toggle $LAVA_INSTANCE location

Then you can access the LAVA instance via:
    http://IP/$LAVA_INSTANCE

You also can turn it back with the command below::

 $ lava-deployment-tool toggle $LAVA_INSTANCE vhost

Then you can access the LAVA instance via:
    http://virtual-host/

There is also a command to toggle all LAVA instances one time::

    lava-deployment-tool toggle_all location

Anatomy of a LAVA instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An instance is composed of several parts:

 - A new system user account called lava-$LAVA_INSTANCE
 - A directory tree similar to standard unix filesystem rooted
   in $LAVA_PREFIX/$LAVA_INSTANCE/
 - A postgres user and database in the default cluster, both named
   lava-$LAVA_INSTANCE

A note on Postgres versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

lava-deployment-tool creates its databases in the default postgres
cluster (on Ubuntu this is the 'main' cluster of whichever version of
postgres was installed first).  Using a different version/cluster and
moving between versions is not technically difficult but not currently
supported.

Different kinds of deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Production-like
---------------

For our production deployment, we use the buildout-production.cfg
buildout file which completely locks down the version of everything
that's being deployed.  If you want to run the same kind of deployment
as we do, set LAVA_BUILDOUT_CFG to ``buildout-production.cfg`` when
creating the instance::

 $ LAVA_BUILDOUT_CFG=buildout-production.cfg lava-deployment-tool install production

To update the version of some component that is deployed we release
that component, update the buildout-production.cfg file in
lp:lava-server to refer to the new version and deploy the new
revision.

Local Development
-----------------

There is a distinction between doing work on a branch of
``lava-server`` itself and working on a branch of some other component
such as ``lava-scheduler``.

Working on a lava-server branch
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create an instance if needed.  Make a branch of lava-server inside
$instance/code/::

 $ cd /srv/lava/instances/testinstance/code
 $ bzr branch lp:lava-server shiny-feature
 $ cp -r current/{eggs,download-cache,bin} shiny-feature # This line is a hack!
 $ cd shiny-feature
 $ ./bin/buildout
 $ cd ..
 $ ln -sfT shiny-feature current

Then you can hack inside shiny-feature as required.

Working on the branch of another component
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Again, create an instance if needed.  Put a branch, or a symlink to a
branch, of the component you wish to work in into
/srv/lava/instances/$instances/code/current/local.  Run buildout.
Hack.  Profit.  For example::

  $ bzr branch lp:lava-scheduler ~/src/my-scheduler-branch
  $ cd /srv/lava/instances/$instances/code/current
  $ ln -s ~/src/my-scheduler-branch local/ # The name of the symlink doesn't matter;
                                           # buildout looks at the setup.py
  $ ./bin/buildout

Limited Deployments
-------------------

For a limited deployment, for example if you do not want to run the
scheduler, you can set ``LAVA_BUILDOUT_CFG`` to point to a buildout
config file you create.  Currently you can only do this after an
instance is created (unfortunately).  So create an instance::

 $ lava-deployment-tool install limited

Create the custom buildout.cfg::

 $ cat > /srv/lava/instances/limited/code/custom.cfg <<EOF
 [buildout]
 extends = buildout.cfg

 [server]
 eggs -= lava-scheduler
 EOF

And set it to be used in ``instance.conf``::

 $ vim /srv/lava/instances/limited/code/custom.cfg
 $ grep LAVA_BUILDOUT_CFG /srv/lava/instances/limited/code/custom.cfg
 LAVA_BUILDOUT_CFG='../custom.cfg'

Finally, 'upgrade' the instance to get it to use the new config file::

 $ ./lava-deployment-tool upgrade limited
